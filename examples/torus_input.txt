Create a 2D torus network topology arranged in a 2x2 grid. Define exactly four nodes:
- n00 at row 0, col 0
- n01 at row 0, col 1
- n10 at row 1, col 0
- n11 at row 1, col 1

Topology rules:
- Each node must have exactly 4 interfaces named port0, port1, port2, port3.
- Every node must connect to its left, right, up, and down neighbor with wrap-around.
- All ports must be used — no port may remain unconnected.
- All connections must be point-to-point.
- No duplicate links and no self-links.

Required neighbor mapping:
- n00 neighbors: left=n01, right=n01, up=n10, down=n10
- n01 neighbors: left=n00, right=n00, up=n11, down=n11
- n10 neighbors: left=n11, right=n11, up=n00, down=n00
- n11 neighbors: left=n10, right=n10, up=n01, down=n01

Port assignment rules:
- port0 = horizontal-left neighbor
- port1 = horizontal-right neighbor
- port2 = vertical-up neighbor
- port3 = vertical-down neighbor

Expected connections (explicit):
- n00.port0 <-> n01.port1
- n00.port1 <-> n01.port0
- n00.port2 <-> n10.port3
- n00.port3 <-> n10.port2

- n01.port0 <-> n00.port1
- n01.port1 <-> n00.port0
- n01.port2 <-> n11.port3
- n01.port3 <-> n11.port2

- n10.port0 <-> n11.port1
- n10.port1 <-> n11.port0
- n10.port2 <-> n00.port3
- n10.port3 <-> n00.port2

- n11.port0 <-> n10.port1
- n11.port1 <-> n10.port0
- n11.port2 <-> n01.port3
- n11.port3 <-> n01.port2

Output format:
List every link explicitly in the format:
<node>.portX  <node>.portY

Constraints:
- The final graph must have no isolated ports.
- Connectivity must be fully defined (no null graph).
