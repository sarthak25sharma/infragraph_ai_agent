    ### Overview
    InfraGraph or `infrastructure graph` defines a model-driven, vendor-neutral, standard
    interface for capturing a system of systems suitable for use in co-designing AI/HPC solutions.

    This model allows for defining physical infrastructure as a logical system of systems using graph like terminology.
    In addition to defining a logical graph, an unlimited number of different physical characteristics
    can be associated with logical endpoints.

    ### Graph Terminology
    - an infrastructure `node (vertex)` is the fundamental unit or entity within an infrastructure graph; represented as a endpoint with the following syntax:
      - a combination of a device instance name and a 0 based index and a component name and a 0 based index such as `switch.0.asic.0` and `switch.0.port.0`
    - an infrastructure `edge` is a combination of two `nodes (endpoints)` in a graph such as (`switch.0.asic.0`, `switch.0.port.0`)
    - `path` is a sequence of edges that allows for traversal through the graph such as [`server.0.npu.0`, `server.0.nic.0`, `switch.0.port.0`, `switch.0.asic.0`]

        Given an infrastructure object this API method will create a fully qualified infrastructure graph and validate it.

        Creating a fully qualified infrastructure graph requires the following steps:
          - process each of the infrastructure instance objects by locating the device and creating a subgraph using the device's edges and substituting the instance name for the device name.
          - process each of the infrastructure edges, looking up the instance to determine the max count and the name to be substituted for the device and link the subgraphs to create a complete infrastructure graph
